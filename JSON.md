# Security Policy Generator JSON file Specifications

The Security Policy Generator JSON file contains all the information required to create the template for Security Policy generation. In order to facilitate the usage and ease of modification we used of JSON file format. JSON is both readable/writable by non-tech savvies and tech savvies as well as easy to integrate into the code. The file represents a template for a general security policy with place holders for variables that change based on the use case. The structure of the file is based on the following assumptions:

The hierarchy of the sections is limited to two (2) layers, namely sections and subsections.
Content text contains limited number of variables to substitute, which are provided by the JSON file or by the user.
Each section will be represented as a page with subsections in collapsible paragraphs.
